# FPL Analytics Project

## Overview

This repository houses the FPL Analytics project, a comprehensive data analysis tool tailored for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) enthusiasts. Leveraging Looker Studio, the project provides an interactive dashboard that helps users make informed decisions about their FPL line-ups.

## Data Categories

We process and categorize player data into five main areas:

1. **Generic**: Basic player statistics including appearances, minutes played, etc.
2. **Shooting**: Metrics related to shot accuracy, goals scored, and more.
3. **Goalkeeping**: Metrics specific to goalkeepers such as saves, clean sheets, and more.
4. **Passing**: Metrics like key passes, successful crosses, etc.
5. **Defensive**: Defensive statistics including tackles, interceptions, and clearances.

### Data Utilization in Dashboard

- **Attackers and Midfielders**: The dashboard uses data from the 'Generic', 'Shooting', and 'Passing' categories to evaluate and rank attacking and midfield players, focusing on their goal-making and assist capabilities.
  
- **Goalkeepers**: The dashboard relies on 'Goalkeeping' data for a thorough analysis of goalkeepers.
  
- **Defenders**: The 'Defensive' data category informs the defender rankings.

## Dashboard Tables

The processed data feeds into three main tables in the dashboard:

1. **Attackers and Midfielders Table**
2. **Goalkeepers Table**
3. **Defenders Table**

These tables help to identify the most suitable players for your FPL team.

## How to Use

The dashboard is intuitive and user-friendly:

1. **Player Selection**: For each of the three tables, you can filter players based on their position, team, and price factor.
   
2. **Sorting**: By default, players are sorted by their total FPL points. You can re-sort the table based on any available column.
   
3. **Data Updates**: The dashboard is updated after each FPL gameweek, ensuring that you have the latest information at your fingertips.
